This is quite frankly an idiotic way of doing it, since in this data set you are guaranteed to get FN's which is verry bad, or the other way around.

Since gradience-based optimisation works by taking small steps based on the \"evenness\" of it's slope to get to the bottom of the slope, if it has too few steps, too short steps, or too big steps it will not converge on the local optimal solution. Doing some brute force testing it needs max_iter at about 3825. But more importantly in the EDA we found out that there were significant divergencies in the scale of some features. As the model used requires aproximately equal scale, this is most probably undermining the results.\n"

    "The preprocessing steps used in the pipeline consisted of feature scaling using `StandardScaler` and dimensionality reduction using PCA. `StandardScaler` was applied to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model, while PCA was used to reduce redundancy among highly correlated features prior to fitting the logistic regression classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA was configured to retain cumVarCount (10) components in order to reduce dimensionality while preserving most of the variance in the original feature space. Based on the EDA, several features exhibited strong correlations, indicating redundancy in the dataset. Reducing the feature space to 10 principal components allows the model to capture the most informative structure in the data while mitigating noise and multicollinearity, resulting in a more stable logistic regression model. This further means that we don't have to manually remove features as PCA will ensure that only the most principle components are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "All preprocessing steps were implemented within a scikit-learn Pipeline to prevent data leakage. By fitting the scaler and PCA exclusively on the training data and subsequently applying the learned transformations to the test data, the evaluation more accurately reflects how the model would perform on unseen patients. This ensures that no information from the test set influences either preprocessing or model training.\n"
