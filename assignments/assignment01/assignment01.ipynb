    "Markdown accuracy is 62,3% which by itself would disqualify this model from being used in diagnosis of cancer in patients since its lower than the average for clinical professionals (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12047852/). The model uses whatever the highest true label is and categorizes all other predictions in the same category, predicted label: benign since true label: benign is most likely. This is quite frankly an idiotic way of doing it, since in this data set you are guaranteed to get FN's which is verry bad, or the other way around. People who don't actually have cancer get diagnosed with it in 100% of cases where they don't. The way it classifies cases doesn't allow it to change the guesses it makes unless the true label: malignant > true label: benign, which is highly unlikely to happen. This also disqualifies this model from being used. In short I wouldn't trust it.\n"

    "#### Answer\n",
    "The model did not converge as it hit the upper limit posed by max_iter. Since gradience-based optimisation works by taking small steps based on the \"evenness\" of it's slope to get to the bottom of the slope, if it has too few steps, too short steps, or too big steps it will not converge on the local optimal solution. Doing some brute force testing it needs max_iter at about 3825. But more importantly in the EDA we found out that there were significant divergencies in the scale of some features. As the model used requires aproximately equal scale, this is most probably undermining the results.\n"

    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing steps used in the pipeline consisted of feature scaling using `StandardScaler` and dimensionality reduction using PCA. `StandardScaler` was applied to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model, while PCA was used to reduce redundancy among highly correlated features prior to fitting the logistic regression classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA was configured to retain cumVarCount (10) components in order to reduce dimensionality while preserving most of the variance in the original feature space. Based on the EDA, several features exhibited strong correlations, indicating redundancy in the dataset. Reducing the feature space to 10 principal components allows the model to capture the most informative structure in the data while mitigating noise and multicollinearity, resulting in a more stable logistic regression model. This further means that we don't have to manually remove features as PCA will ensure that only the most principle components are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "All preprocessing steps were implemented within a scikit-learn Pipeline to prevent data leakage. By fitting the scaler and PCA exclusively on the training data and subsequently applying the learned transformations to the test data, the evaluation more accurately reflects how the model would perform on unseen patients. This ensures that no information from the test set influences either preprocessing or model training.\n"
